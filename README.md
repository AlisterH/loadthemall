# Load Them All
QGIS plugin that recursively loads vector and raster layers stored in a directory structure, based on several filters.

Available filters are:
* Alphanumeric:
* Bounding box:
* Geometry type:
* Raster type:

There are several options for you to configure how layers should be loaded to QGIS:
* Groups
* Make loaded layers invisible
* Do not load empty layers
* Ignore case in the alphanumeric filter
* Ignore accents in the alphanumeric filter
